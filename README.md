# Hate Speech Detection API

A powerful Flask-based API that detects hate speech in text using machine learning. The API supports real-time analysis, multiple languages, and provides alternative suggestions for toxic words.

## Features

- üîç Real-time hate speech detection
- üåê Multi-language support with automatic translation
- üí° Alternative word suggestions for toxic content
- üîë API key authentication with tiered access
- ‚ö° WebSocket support for real-time analysis
- üîí Rate limiting based on API tier

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, NLTK
- **Real-time Communication**: Flask-SocketIO
- **Language Detection**: langdetect
- **Translation**: googletrans
- **Deployment**: Railway.app, Render

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepanik/Hate-Speech.git
cd Hate-Speech
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download required NLTK data:
```python
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

## Environment Setup

Make sure you have the following environment variables set:
- `PORT`: The port number for the application (default: 5000)

## API Usage

### Authentication

All API endpoints require an API key passed in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer your-api-key
```

### Endpoints

1. **GET /** - Home page
2. **GET /api-docs** - API documentation
3. **POST /api/create-key** - Create a new API key
4. **POST /analyze** - Analyze text for hate speech

### WebSocket Events

- `analyze_text` - Send text for real-time analysis
- `analysis_result` - Receive analysis results
- `analysis_error` - Receive error messages

## API Tiers

- **Free**: 100 requests/day
- **Basic**: 1,000 requests/day
- **Premium**: 10,000 requests/day
- **Enterprise**: Unlimited requests

## Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Railway.app. The necessary configuration files (`Procfile`) are included in the repository.

To deploy:
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect your repository to Railway
3. Railway will automatically deploy your application

## Deployment on Render

This project is configured for easy deployment on Render. Follow these steps:

1. Fork or push this repository to your GitHub account
2. Create a new account on [Render](https://render.com) if you haven't already
3. In the Render dashboard, click on "New +" and select "Web Service"
4. Connect your GitHub account and select this repository
5. Configure the deployment:
   - Name: `hate-speech-api` (or your preferred name)
   - Environment: `Python`
   - Region: Choose the closest to your users
   - Branch: `main` (or your default branch)
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `gunicorn --worker-class eventlet -w 1 app:app`
   - Plan: Free

The deployment will automatically begin. Once completed, you can access your API at the provided Render URL.

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are automatically configured in the `render.yaml`:
- `PORT`: 8000
