# Hate Speech Detection API

A powerful Flask-based API that detects hate speech in text using machine learning. The API supports real-time analysis, multiple languages, and provides alternative suggestions for toxic words.

## Features

- üîç Real-time hate speech detection
- üåê Multi-language support with automatic translation
- üí° Alternative word suggestions for toxic content
- üîë API key authentication with tiered access
- ‚ö° WebSocket support for real-time analysis
- üîí Rate limiting based on API tier

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: Flask
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, NLTK
- **Real-time Communication**: Flask-SocketIO
- **Language Detection**: langdetect
- **Translation**: googletrans
- **Deployment**: Railway.app

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deepanik/Hate-Speech.git
cd Hate-Speech
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download required NLTK data:
```python
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
```

## Environment Setup

Make sure you have the following environment variables set:
- `PORT`: The port number for the application (default: 5000)

## API Usage

2. **GET /api-docs** - API documentation
3. **POST /api/create-key** - Create a new API key
4. **POST /analyze** - Analyze text for hate speech

### WebSocket Events

- `analyze_text` - Send text for real-time analysis
- `analysis_result` - Receive analysis results
- `analysis_error` - Receive error messages
